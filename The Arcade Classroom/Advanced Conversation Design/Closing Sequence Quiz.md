#### **Question 2:** What’s a human-like closing technique not commonly found in traditional virtual agents?  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. ⚪ Ensure the call gets disconnected after the agent says “bye” in case the user never replies.  
2. ⚪ End the call thanking the user as soon as they say there’s nothing else they want to do.  
3. ⚪ Ask the user if there is anything else they need help with in case they have other issues. 
4. 🟢 **Allow the user to react to each pre-closing to ensure they’re ready to end the conversation.**
